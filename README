Project 3 of CS61B.

Implements a graph package, which is then used in trip finder and make.

Trip finder uses the graph package's undirected graph and A* search to find the shortest route between two input locations in a textual map file.

Make uses the graph package's directed graph and DFS to track file dependencies.
